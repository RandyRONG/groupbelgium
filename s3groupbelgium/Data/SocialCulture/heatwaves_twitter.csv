@MissAshes92 @JackSillin @bnorcross Whether your name them or categorize them - there needs to be a sense of urgency associated with them. The archaic definition of a �heatwave� doesn�t help with. A generic 3 consecutive days of 90+ is not helpful.

He appeared in 5 DC CW shows and in 91 episodes over 7 years. Heatwave is an iconic character come on lol.

the word fetishize come from the word fetish... which can literally ONLY have a sexual meaning. the author of heatwaves didnt fetishize mlm, however had the author wrote smut on dnf while not being mlm it might make me a little uncomfortable -another mlm"

all of you getting mad at alex for reading fanfics on stream as if you dont spam heatwaves or any other popular fanfics in chat when something slightly related to that fic happens
HELP HEATWAVES HAS POSSESSED MY PHONE-
PLEASE IDK WHY MY PHONE WONT COPY ANYTHING OTHER THAN HEATWAVES-
Wait Heatwaves is hella angst?
"or maybe clarify in the fic you dont want it being read by cc's, like in heatwaves..? is your choice to write it in the first place, no ones forcing you to plus its literally ABOUT them.. https://t.co/sqkEHvR2a9"
@always___alexis ISIT ALL JSUT HEATWAVES
@mikadespacito how dream thinks he is in heatwaves is how sapnap is in heatwaves
Now that we�ve all read wattpad fanfics together on stream petition for dream to finally read heatwaves so he can know what he�s referencing &lt;/3
dream i forgive you for commenting under logan paul�s tweet about heatwaves pls go live
Also George read heatwaves before how is it he's first time with fanfictions ?<U+0001F62D>
@flowinlikeariv WIT WHAT GEORGE IS READING HEATWAVES?!
@gnfonly i read 7 chapters of heatwaves in one day
"//dnf
I just watched dream shorts, and guess what was the advertisement..
#HeatWaves
#dnf https://t.co/yh0zcSkwve"
"stans: dont make heatwaves all about dnf its its own song leave it alone

dream: hold my beer"
"George being so awkward while reading this.,,, i�m just . how the heck did sapnap read heatwaves to him i genuinely want to know <U+0001F9CD>"
"so now I gotta read heatwaves, four chapters of helium, AND ff1970?? dang how am I gonna make it through this"
@mellowdwt ummm I don�t think so other than dream responding to logan paul�s heatwaves twt anddd dream announcing that the next manhunt is coming out on friday
omg i saw logan paul�s tweet and heatwaves j came on shuffle <U+0001F481><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>
do i reread heatwaves rn. be honest.
"dream: I READ HEATWAVES UR JUST COCKSUCKING

gnf: bb,.,, oyf- <U+0001F61F>"
me when i hear heatwaves after being told hundreds of times that its not all about the fic https://t.co/OKyH5Jmn4G
"oh my fucking god...
the people being neg in qts and generalizing all writers have ONE HUNDRED FUCKING PERCENT read heatwaves and dear dream and every other popular dnf fanfiction. they love consuming popular content, but will shit on writers <U+0001F928><U+0001F928><U+0001F928>"
"me trying to enjoy heatwaves without... thinking... about... real life people ship...

pain"
o george t� claramente sofrendo enquanto l� nem parece que ele fez o sapnap ler heatwaves pra ele
no because why is this actually heatwaves all over again
i was just watching youtube and Heatwaves was my ad <U+0001F601><U+0001F601><U+203C><U+FE0F> https://t.co/XSQKxUh11w
feels like heatwaves all over again ngl <U+0001F610>
i kinda spoiled the last chapter of heatwaves for myself and now i dont wanna read it <U+0001F610>
im gonna confess that ive read heatwaves twice but i still havent read the last chapter so now i feel like i cant move on
WHY IS HEATWAVES IN HERE https://t.co/z8hSqGcPaB
@SeanTheDweeb who�s name did both heatwaves and helium use..? that�s not right wtf
"@SeanTheDweeb i have no idea cause i never read heatwaves, i see a lot of ppl saying they did but i hope they�re not getting pass bc it�s like everyones favorite fanfic <U+0001F574>"
"@catb0yranboo i havent read any of the sequels but heatwaves has some implied nsfw, it�s nothing too heavy but it could be uncomfortable"
@karlsquackity dream is fr in his heatwaves arc rn
@lilacfev ok basically dream apparently thinks hes being a chad in heatwaves (a dnf fanfic) but in the fic hes actually crying 12 chapters straight
How did Sapnap and George manage to read heatwaves together
this is actually giving heatwaves vibes
last time a fic blew up it was heatwaves and that just absolutely fucked with me so much
"them reading fanfic is gna be so bad oh god im terrified ,, it could be the cringiest shit ever or a full heatwaves reading"
our heatwaves era https://t.co/Cf9byUSCkh
"heatwaves (the fic and the song) fucked me up so bad i stg,, like i developed a massive crush on someone last year which resulted in them becoming my fp .... because heatwaves came into my head when i was talking to them"
wna go back to before george went to his grandparents house in heatwaves... the rest of that fic ruined my life /hj
no cos why is george completely comfortable having sapnap read heatwaves to him offstream but cant say the word boyfriend onstream
sobbing helium is so much more fluff than heatwaves im so giggly
hes gonna pull up heatwaves
so george cant read anything romantic in this fic but will read a whole chapter of heatwaves??? <U+0001F928>?????
"This is the opposite of Heatwaves 

I said what I said"
"yes, we get it dnf�rs can be annoying when the topic of glass animals comes into the spotlight but can we PLEASE stop shitting on anyone who�s favorite song of glass animals is heatwaves? they�re allowed to have their own opinion, jesus."
did we forget that sapnap has a ao3 acc coz he read heatwaves???
@DAlSUKEHQ �YOU SOMMOND US CAUS YOU SAID SOMETIMES!!! LIKE HEATWAVES WOOO�
"@akagnf Same, only one I genuinely like is ff1970 which I haven�t finished yet

And technically heatwaves, to me it�s pretty over hyped but I did enjoy it and helium is really good so"
@B0XEDLIKEAFISH Didn�t he read heatwaves or <U+0001F600>
@honkilene K I�m sorry but didn�t heatwaves use real names?? It�s just such a hyped up story but I�m pretty sure boundaries were crossed
@SAPNAPL1VE ON THE SAME DAY DREAM MAKES A HEATWAVES DNF REFERENCE
"@URMUMSBUTTHOL11 Yeah it is lmfao! 

Concepts and plot are what matter most to me. Ofc how it�s written does too, a good book needs a good writing style, but not as much. That�s why ff1970 stood out to me while heatwaves was kinda eh."
@marxellow @mxringz @yami__two @honkilene But didn�t heatwaves and helium use his real name? (Using those as examples since they�re huge fics)
"@URMUMSBUTTHOL11 No that�s fine lmao!! 

The genre and concept was right up my ally so I enjoyed it a lot. It was mainly the ending that hurt just since everything that was being built up in the story tumbled down

I was like that with heatwaves, I didn�t get it honestly"
"�but today i see our reflections clearly on hollywood laying on the screen�

george and sapnap read heatwaves together...this is not georges first rodeo
@sapsbee Oh I didn�t mean it like that I meant like finding heatwaves and glass animals through dnf my wording was kinda confusing though

no because was quackity about to bring up the fact that sapnap read heatwaves to him
Nooo he was gonna say he knows Sapnap read heatwaves to George

"@dreamxdhangout helium is the sequel to heatwaves fanfic, yes <U+0001F480>"
"mcyttiktok is so weird, no offense. any video with the audio heatwaves and all the comments are mcyt related. �you summoned mcyt� �dnfers have been called� NO. separate the song from the fanfiction. its not our song its GLASS ANIMALS and its for everyone."
"honestly though i feel bad for the author of heatwaves. amazing work, i think they might be embarassed that their book turned into such a spotlight for mcyt and its the reason everyone gatekeeps the song and gets mad at others for using it who arent in mcyt"
"anyways, sorry for so many tweets abt heatwaves. its just so annoying that whenever the song is mentioned or heard or anything, mcyt fans cant realize that its not mcyts song, and to separate it from the fanfiction. its embarassing for all of us and the AUTHOR."

Its a real song that Glass Animals worked hard on creating that gets ruined over this fandom and dnf . It's bad enough on tiktok . So please just keep it there. You guys are the reason others get do much hate ."
@4kchelou ik! Glass animals has such good music! I hate how they are just showed as the people who made heatwaves :/
"there�s no problem associating a song w something (ex: fallen down w ran boo, heatwaves w the fic) but STOP making the songs SOLE MEANING be that! especially when someone references with no context to how YOU know it. ur not �summoned� by a reference, it�s just the algorithm :)))"
"someone just says ""what is heatwaves"" or anything related to that
and yall go like 
""FANFIC""
""DNF""
yall are acting like mcyttiktok plz  <U+0001F61E> stop"
"yall, glass animals make bangers

@souperpumped honestly i have heard heatwaves so many times that i'm pretty sure it's my least favourite at this point /hj
"like please, can you all stop mentioning dnf when heatwaves is mentioned"
My co-worker just had Heatwaves on shuffle and let me tell you I forgot that I can encounter that in the wild and just took 24 psychic damage #dsmp
@LoganPaul HEATWAVES IS SUCH A BOP SLDNDN
I don't know how long I'll be able to stay up the only time I pulled an allnighter was in January because of heatwaves and I nearly passed out the next day lmao

"the way i haven�t even read heatwaves so like even the song name to me is just simply a song. idk why people associate it with dnf, its literally just a good song, that is it."

"@pearldnp okay so i�m a glass animals fan right. it wasn�t just the dnf fan fiction, heatwaves also got featured in a FIFA game. so basically both fandoms blew the song up"
"people who comment ""dnf"" anytime the band does something related to heatwaves are the weakest link"
@bunnygirlmoon I've purposefully not listen to heatwaves because of this fandom
i can finally breathe easy when people will stop associating heatwaves with dnf
@LoganPaul heatwaves been faking me out idk the rest of the lyrics
if you only associate heatwaves (the song) with dnf i dislike you very much

@jamesrolypoly if u cried at heatwaves u might just sob at this one
"@astr0nomika the thing is, even when i read dnf fan fictions i see them as different people then in irl. so i don�t really associate them with them irl. and the fandom itself. i do really enjoy it! try to ignore the 12 year olds that compare heatwaves. they are the same people who say �DNFF�"
"okay maybe im going to read 'flowers from 1970'

but i cried so bad at heatwaves u dont think i can do it <U+0001F590><U+0001F62C>"

All I�m saying is dream probably laughed at heatwaves and thought it was funny and ridiculous to see him and his friend portrayed like that but he has said he�s an emotional guy and reading ff1970 would make him sob :(
@senorheatmiser @IsaacWxObserver lol its hard to get heatwaves on the coast in july let alone september.  Doesn't happen.  Last 90 in September was 2018.  Only 15/73 years at bdr have at least 1 90 in September.  Its not a full summer month like july and august are

@Corner_Husband Omg do you have a link??? If not I can try to find it.. it�s so bad but she took heatwaves down I think bc I had to find it on Wattpad bc it wasn�t on ao3 anymore
Unpopular opinion: Heatwaves had a really bad ending. It started out good and had a good beginning and middle but the ending was not good. #dreamnotfound #GEORGENOTFOUND #GEORGE #dream #dnf
"ao3 suddenly not working while reading a danganronpa fic

DID HEATWAVES UPDATE?!?!? even tho probably just intenet error"
heatwaves isn�t even that bad as some of y�all make it out to be

@stylesmoon29 Not an option but bro the ending of Heatwaves got me bad......
@sorayawastaken flowers from 1970 is the only fanfic i�ve read ( aside from heatwaves ) + i don�t see them any different cause i see them more as characters rather than the actual people and i can never really relate the irl people to the stories cause they�re just characters in the story to me
Heatwaves will forever be my favourite but ff1970 has fucking broke me
"@madasazar that makes sense! I was thinking about reading heatwaves. have you read ff1970 because if so, would you consider that our time if that makes sense? if you haven�t read it nvm lol dw!!"
"@sorayawastaken no. but i prefer to read AUs more than actual fics about them as people (like heatwaves would have been the only one like that that i read). even back when i was younger and read rpf like a lot, as long as i didnt read a fic set in our time, it never made me look at it different"
Why did heatwaves immediately start playing in his Spotify sir- <U+0001F600>
